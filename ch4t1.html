                <p>Panel analysis results demonstrate that the JBS slaughterhouses were significantly less likely to purchase from properties with recent deforestation by 2012 (p < 0.001).  Prior to the agreements, deforestation did not have a statistically significant impact on their purchasing selection.  At least some of the deforestation assessed by our models for 2010 and 2011 occurred prior to the agreements; 2012 is the first year we would expect a full response (Table S1).</p>
