            Surge in Zero-Deforestation Commitments

            <div class="tangent-article-text">
                <p>In the past several years, there has been a surge in zero-deforestation commitments. In 2010, the <a href="http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/"><u>Consumer Goods Forum (CGF)</u></a>, a global industry network of more than 400 retailers, manufacturers, service providers, and associations, approved a board resolution, pledging to mobilize resources to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020.<sup class="citation-number">27</sup> The CGF aims to achieve this through the responsible sourcing of key agricultural commodities, including beef. In support for this commitment, the CGF created the <a href="http://www.tfa2020.com/"><u>Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA)</u></a>, to help address deforestation and the sourcing of beef and other key commodities, bringing together industry, national governments and civil society groups in the largest public-private initiative of this type.</p>
                <p>In 2014, governments, multi-national companies, and civil society groups came together at the United Nations Climate Summit to sign the <a href="http://www.un-redd.org/portals/15/documents/ForestsDeclarationText.pdf"><u>New York Declaration on Forests</u></a>, a pledge to support public and private sector goals aimed at eliminating deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities, including beef. A few of the key target outcomes include:<sup class="citation-number">28</sup></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Cut the rate of global deforestation in half by 2020 and strive to end forest loss by 2030.</li> 
                <li>Restore 150 million hectares of degraded landscapes by 2020 and 200 million hectares by 2030.</li>
                <li>Strengthen forest governance and transparency</li><li>Reward countries and jurisdictions that, by taking action, reducing forest emissions – particularly through public policy and private sector sourcing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Achieving these (and other) target outcomes could reduce emissions by 4.5 – 8.8 billion tons per year by 2030.</p>
                <p>In addition, a myriad of retailers and manufacturers have stepped up, individually, to make commitments to zero-deforestation, including prominent global brands, such as Mars<sup class="citation-number">29</sup>, Colgate-Palmolive<sup class="citation-number">30</sup>, Walmart<sup class="citation-number">31</sup>, <sup class="citation-number">32</sup>, Tesco<sup class="citation-number">33</sup>, and many more. Commitments to zero-deforestation production are helping support positive solution-oriented improvements throughout the value chain. The implementation of these commitments will drive on-the-ground transformation and help ensure that beef, leather, and tallow can continue to be produced in the Brazilian Amazon without jeopardizing tropical forests, and other valuable ecosystems.</p>
