                <p>The Brazilian Forest Code was first established in 1965, establishing a legal framework for forest governance in Brazil. Since then, it has undergone several revisions, most recent of which occurred in 2012, when controversial amendments were introduced that many conservationists felt weakened the law. Despite these recent changes, the Brazilian Forest Code remains one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation governing forests on private lands in the world.</p>
                
                <p>One of the most important components of the Forest Code are the Legal Reserves (LR), which establish the minimum area (as a percentage of the property) that must remain as primary forest vegetation. The Forest Code forbids deforestation in the LR.</p>
