                <p>The cattle supply chain in Brazil is made up of a complex network of producers, which cover various segments and combinations of the three primary productions phases: (1) breeding, (2) rearing, and (3) fattening.</p>
                <p><b>Production Phases</b>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fattening (finishing)

                            <li>Limited (if any) monitoring and traceability on these properties. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>Feeder phase covering reproduction, suckling, and early maturity. </li>
                                <li>Indirect Suppliers (Tier 3 ranches) that sell to rearing (stocker) operations and other production phases, but transfers between breeding operations can also occur. </li>
                                <li>Limited (if any) monitoring and traceability on these properties. </li>

                    <p><b>Typology of Ranches </b>
                        <br>
                    <p>Ranches can cover various phases (and combinations of phases) of the production cycle. For example, a ranch could only operate under the breeding (cow-calf) phase, or could include both breeding and rearing phases. In addition, some ranches in Brazil are considered full-cycle, covering all phases of the production cycle (breeding, rearing, and fattening). Transfers and movement of cattle can occur throughout every phase of the production cycle, including ranch-to-ranch transfers (e.g. formal and informal transactions), auctions, traders and other middlemen. The potential for cattle to physically move (sometimes multiple transfers) between ranches, creates challenges for the traceability and monitoring of Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. Support for efforts aimed addressing indirect suppliers (Tier 2 and Tier 3 ranches) will help close some of the current gaps in monitoring, reduce risks, and help ensure fully verified zero-deforestation supply chains for Brazilian cattle products.</p>
