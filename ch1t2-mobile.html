    <div class="tangent-article-caption"> Beef produced on recently deforested land can result in up to 25 times more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than beef produced on established pastures. </div>
    <div class="tangent-article-text">
          <p>The global beef industry has recently faced mounting criticism due to the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint associated with cattle production,<sup class="citation-number">18</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class="citation-number">19</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class="citation-number">20</sup>  which is much larger than other forms of livestock, and amounts to about 9% of total global GHG emissions.<sup class="citation-number">21</sup> There are a wide range of emissions sources associated with cattle, including enteric fermentation (a large source of methane emissions from digestive processes), feed production for use in concentrated feedlots, and land use change, such as deforestation. </p>
          <p>Therefore, all cattle production systems produce emissions, but where forests are cleared for pasture, the deforestation emissions are even larger. Cattle produced on recently deforested land in the Brazilian Amazon can have a GHG footprint that is up to 25 times higher than cattle produced on established pasture (28 versus 726 kg CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per kg of meat, respectively).<sup class="citation-number">22</sup> Therefore, one of the most effective ways to reduce the GHG footprint of beef, leather, tallow and other cattle-derived products is to ensure that cattle are produced under a fully verified zero deforestation system. </p>
          <p>In addition, support for ranching practices that improve productivity on established pastures can help decrease emissions per animal. Moderate intensification, which includes relatively low-tech and cost effective practices, such as fencing, rotational grazing, and improved grass mixtures can help improve productivity and recover degraded pastures.<sup class="citation-number">23</sup> Therefore, the cattle sector can continue to meet growing demand for beef, leather, tallow, and other cattle-derived products without further deforestation. This outcome can be achieved while improving the profitability of the ranching sector and reducing GHG emissions on a per unit basis. </p>
