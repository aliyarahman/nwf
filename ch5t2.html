                <b>Certification – Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN)</b>
                <p>
                    The <a href="http://san.ag/web/">Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN)</a> Standard for Sustainable Cattle Production Systems provides a voluntary certification system for cattle ranches that are interested in improving their environmental, social, labor, and operational performance and marketing their products with the <a href="http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/agriculture/certification">Rainforest Alliance Certified Seal</a>. The standard, which only applies to farms where cattle have access to pasture, includes the following principles: integrated management systems, sustainable pasture management, animal welfare and carbon-footprint reduction.

                <b>Animal Tagging (RFID)</b>
                <p>
                    Unique identification and tracking of cattle, through the use of RFID (radio-frequency identification) microchip technology, can provide georeferenced data and biophysical information. This technology can be used to geo-reference the location of cattle and track movement across a landscape. It can also be used to optimize productivity, enabling precise monitoring of weight gain and other biophysical indicators. Once a chip is implanted in the animal, the animal’s location can be identified and information about the animal can be accessed, such as date of birth, breed, owner, health and immunization records. The use of RFID microchips can significantly improve traceability and monitoring of cattle throughout the entire production cycle, from birth to slaughter. Despite its advantages for both traceability and productivity, this technology can be cost-prohibitive for some producers, especially small holders which may be unable to leverage economies of scales.

                <b>Territorial Performance System (Jurisdictional Approach)</b>
                <p>
                    Cattle ranching is one of the leading drivers of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, however, other drivers, such as crop production, mineral extraction, and infrastructure development projects also contribute to the loss of forests in the Amazon. While supply chain solutions are helping transform commodity-specific impacts, there is growing concern that a more holistic cross-commodity approach is needed to ensure safeguards for forests. Although still theoretical,  a jurisdictional approach (e.g. zero-deforestation zones, ZDZ and other territorial performance systems), when integrated with existing supply chain initiatives, REDD+ mechanisms, and forest governance policy may offer a unified approach that drives sustainable production across an entire jurisdiction (national, state, and/or municipal level).

                <b>Roundtables (GRSB and GTPS)</b>
                <p>
                    The <a href="http://grsbeef.org/">Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB)</a> developed Principles and Criteria as a means to define sustainable beef and to provide a framework for advancing continuous improvement in the global beef value chain. Using this as a guiding framework, the <a href="http://www.pecuariasustentavel.org.br/">Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock (GTPS)</a> is developing country-specific standards, indicators, and common practices to be adopted by the sector, which will contribute to the development of sustainable cattle ranching Brazil. The indicators being developed by the GTPS will support continuous improvements in the sector and provide metrics for measuring progress.
