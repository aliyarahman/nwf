            Agricultural Productivity Depends on Amazon Forests
        </div>
        <div class="tangent-article-left-col">
            <div class="tangent-article-text">
                <p>Tropical forests provide valuable ecosystem benefits for local, regional, and global communities. They provide habitat for wildlife, support biodiversity, and remove large amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the atmosphere. Forests also help regulate important bio-geophysical processes, such as precipitation patterns and nutrient cycles, which are critical for the productivity of agriculture.</p>

                <p>The overwhelming majority (80-90%) of all the water that reaches the atmosphere, and eventually become precipitation, comes from land through plant transpiration.<sup class="citation-number">10</sup> This means that the dense moist tropical forests of the Amazon act as giant “water pumps” for much of South America, releasing billions of liters of water from the trees into the atmosphere in the form of water vapor. This process of transpiration in the Amazon, in which massive amounts of water vapor rise from the forests and travel eastwards across the continent, has been referred to as “flying rivers”. These “flying rivers” supply substantial amounts of water to critical agricultural areas and densely populated metropolitan centers.</p>

                <p>The large scale loss of tropical forests in the Amazon can trigger complex interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere.<sup class="citation-number">11</sup> Large-scale deforestation and expansion of agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon may be a “no-win” scenario as climate feedbacks are likely to (1) reduce the quantity and frequency of overall average precipitation,<sup class="citation-number">12</sup> (2) increase mean temperatures and heat extremes,<sup class="citation-number">13</sup> and (3) increase the length of the dry season and the severity of droughts.<sup class="citation-number">14</sup> The degradation of these critical ecosystem services could significantly jeopardize the potential productivity of agricultural for the region.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, deforestation in the Amazon can act as a driver of global climate change and may impact rainfall patterns in areas as far as the western United States.<sup class="citation-number">15</sup> Large scale forest loss in the Amazon has been estimated to potentially reduce precipitation by up to 20% in the coastal northwest United States and by up to 50% in the Sierra Nevada snowpack, jeopardizing critical agricultural production areas.<sup class="citation-number">16</sup></p> 

                <p>Large scale productivity losses in critical agricultural areas could pose drastic consequences for food security and may potentially cause supply shocks in the market and increase the price volatility of agricultural products.</p>

                <p>Commitments to verified zero-deforestation cattle production throughout the supply chain are helping to ensure that forests are conserved, safeguarding the valuable ecosystem benefits that they provide.</p>
