                <p>The global beef industry has recently faced mounting criticism due to the GHG footprint associated with cattle production.<sup class="citation-number">29</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class="citation-number">28</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class="citation-number">30</sup> Cattle produced on recently deforested land in the Brazilian Amazon can have a GHG footprint that is up to 25 times higher than cattle produced on established pasture.<sup class="citation-number">31</sup> Therefore, one of the most effective ways to reduce the GHG footprint of beef, leather, tallow and other cattle-derived products is to ensure that cattle are produced under a verified zero-deforestation system.</p>

                <p>Incentives that encourage sustainable intensification (e.g. fencing, rotational grazing, improved grass mixtures, etc.) could help improve both pasture and herd productivity. Supporting efforts to improve productivity on existing pastures and recover degraded landscapes can reduce pressures to deforest, therefore help further decrease GHG emissions from cattle supply chains.<sup class="citation-number">33</sup></p>
