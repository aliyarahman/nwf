Overall

Spacing




Prequel
- Visibility of summary text (change font or don't go through the clouds)
- Language toggle just at beginning (words, not flags)




Chapter 1

Beef up color on country names for trade maps



Chapter 2
- Bigger eyes, larger forehead area - tapered down to nose (more triangular face, less horse-y)
- Skinnier still!
- Drop hump slightly
- chest/neck skin (defining feature - let's add this)


Chapter 5


Show three indirect suppliers, no enclosures, divide via river or tree (or other visual cue - person, etc). Arrows indicating cattle moving in-between (perhaps with a middleman).

Add text bubble/label to infographic items.

Add trough to direct supplier.

Organizations: three tiers separate by heading - funders, supporters/collaborators, "endorsers"

Downplay auction - need to show arrows from indirect supplier to indirect supplier, enlarge the person to person trade handshake



Still needed from NWF
- Logos, org names
- Photo for recommendations
- Portuguese text
