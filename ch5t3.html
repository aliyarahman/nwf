                On November 5, 2014, the GRSB-GTPS Joint Working Group on Forests (JWG), in collaboration with the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA 2020), held a technical workshop titled Investing in Smart Production during the Global Conference on Sustainable Beef in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.</p>
                <p>The workshop sought to address the challenges involved with integrating the benefits of deforestation-free cattle production and moderate intensification, and fostering investment conditions to facilitate productive and sustainable ranching practices.</p>

            <p><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 1: ZERO-DEFORESTATION COMMITMENTS ARE WORKING</span> 
            <ul>
                <li>The cattle sector has made significant  progress to address deforestation on direct suppliers (Tier 1 Ranches) and these efforts deserve support and recognition.</li>
                <li>Substantial gaps remain in the monitoring and traceability of indirect suppliers (Tier 2 Ranches). Support for efforts that address indirect suppliers is the next step on the path to fully deforestation-free production; this will further reduce risks, help expand market access, and bolster the global reputation of Brazilian beef. </li> 
                <li>Many stakeholders are not yet participating in deforestation-free supply chains. Efforts to expand monitoring and traceability to meatpackers not currently participating in the G4 Cattle Agreement would help increase the coverage of these supply chain initiatives and would level the playing field in this industry.</li> 
                <li>Market incentives linking retailers, meatpackers, and producers coupled with strong government backing can support continued monitoring and traceability from G4 meatpackers as well as encourage wider adoption of these practices to non-G4 meatpackers. </li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><br><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 2: MODERATE INTENSIFICATION HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL</span>
            <ul>
                <li>There remains enormous opportunities to recover degraded pastures, improve productivity (stocking densities and yields), and increase the profitability of Brazilian cattle ranching through the adoption of moderate intensification practices.</li> 
                <li>The G4 Cattle Agreement represents one of the strongest mechanisms currently in place to reduce deforestation in cattle supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon. For moderate intensification to effectively reduce deforestation while avoiding rebound effects and other negative externalities, it should be strategically integrated with the G4 Cattle agreement (or G4-like agreements).</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><br><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 3: FINANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IS AVAILABLE</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Finance for moderate intensification is available; however, issues related to accessibility have created bottlenecks that are limiting the flow of credit.</li>
                <li>A unified and reliable source of information on land tenure, legality, and risk exposure holds great potential to increase the flow of finance to cattle operations.</li> 
                <li>The current cap on technical assistance may be hindering adoption of moderate intensification practices, especially with smaller ranches (< 1,100 hectares).</li>
            </ul></p>
