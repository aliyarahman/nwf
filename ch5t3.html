            Productive Capacity of Existing Pasture

                <p>The current productivity of Brazil’s 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands is only 32–34% of its potential and increasing productivity to 49–52% of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat (as well as crops, wood products, and biofuels) until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems.i As a result up to 14.3 Gt CO2 Eq. could be mitigated.ii</p>
                <p>This means that the current productivity is estimated at 94 million animal units, but the total potential carrying capacity is 274-293 million animal units, indicating a substantial potential to increase productivity.iii The current low productivity levels of Brazilian pasturelands is a result of the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1) low technology levels characterized by inadequate pasture management (overgrazing and lack of maintenance fertilization) leading to a widespread degradation and deficient animal management (health, nutrition and breeding) resulting in low animal performance;iv</li>
                    <li>2) land speculation, where cattle ranching is a means to secure land ownership with an aim to sell the land when the cropland frontier advances (in Brazil, farms that are not actively used can be expropriated for land reform, and extensive cattle ranching is among the simplest form of occupation)v</li>
                    <li>3) insecure land tenure, which discourages investments in increased productivity and incentivizes an extractivist model that leads to degradation;vi 
                    4) lack of long-term credit for the upfront costs of increasing productivity and lack of compliance of the properties with the environmental laws which prevents access to credit;vii</li>
                    <li>5) lack of appropriate extension and training services dedicated to cattle ranching productivity.viii</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pasture degradation is one of the main causes of low productivity of cattle production systems and is a driving force behind deforestation and conversion of native ecosystems. Approximately, 50% of the total areas of cultivated pastures in the Cerradoix and more than 60% in the Amazon biomes are considered degraded.x In 2010, nearly 40% of the deforested land in the Amazon was either degraded pasture or abandoned areas.xi </p>
                <p>Moderate intensification and sustainable ranch management practices can provide potential solutions to help improve pasture and herd productivity. Efforts aimed at addressing the five underlining issues behind low productivity (see above) can help mitigate the potential for pasture degradation and therefore reduce pressures to clear additional forests.</p>
