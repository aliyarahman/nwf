                <p>Brazil’s beef export market has rapidly expanded in recent decades, outpacing the growth of domestic consumption in Brazil. Between 1994 and 2009, domestic consumption of beef increased by nearly 50%.<sup class="citation-number">40</sup> During this same time period, exports increased by over 500%.<sup class="citation-number">41</sup> </p>
                <p>The growth in the relative share of exports helps highlight the increasing importance of global supply chain actors and the level of global market integration of Brazilian beef products, especially in countries such as Russia and China, which account for the majority of trade.</p>
                <p>Through responsible procurement and commitments to verified zero-deforestation production, supply chain actors, both within Brazil and internationally, can support forest-friendly ranching practices and help conserve ecologically sensitive areas, such as the Amazon.</p>
