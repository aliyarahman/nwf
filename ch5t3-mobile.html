            <div class="tangent-article-caption">Current Productivity and Sustainable Carrying Capacity of Cultivated Pasturelands in Brazil.<sup class="citation-number">63</sup></div>
            <div class="tangent-article-text">
                <p>According to <span class="strassburg-et-al">Strassburg et al. 2014</span>, the current productivity of Brazil’s 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands is only 32–34% of its potential; increasing productivity to 49–52% of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat (as well as crops, wood products, and biofuels) until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems.<sup class="citation-number">64</sup> As a result up to 14.3 Gt CO2 Eq. could be mitigated.<sup class="citation-number">65</sup></p>

                <p>This means that the current productivity is estimated at 94 million animal units, but the total potential carrying capacity could be 274-293 million animal units, indicating a substantial potential to increase productivity.<sup class="citation-number">66</sup> As described by <span class="strassburg-et-al">Strassburg, et al. 2014</span>, the current low productivity of Brazilian pasturelands is a result of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1) low technology levels characterized by inadequate pasture management (overgrazing and lack of maintenance fertilization) leading to a widespread degradation and deficient animal management (health, nutrition and breeding) resulting in low animal performance<sup class="citation-number">67</sup>;</li>
                    <li>2) land speculation, where cattle ranching is a means to secure land ownership with an aim to sell it when the cropland frontier advances (in Brazil, farms that are not actively used can be expropriated for land reform, and extensive cattle ranching is among the simplest forms of demonstrating use)<sup class="citation-number">68</sup>;</li>
                    <li>3) insecure land tenure, which discourages investments in increased productivity and incentivizes exploitation that leads to degradation<sup class="citation-number">69</sup>;</li>
                    <li>4) lack of long-term credit for the upfront costs of increasing productivity and lack of compliance of the properties with the environmental laws which prevents access to credit<sup class="citation-number">70</sup>;</li>
                    <li>5) lack of appropriate extension and training services dedicated to cattle ranch productivity.<sup class="citation-number">71</sup></li>
                </ul>
                
            </div>
        
            <p>Pasture degradation is one of the main causes of low productivity of cattle production systems and is a driving force behind deforestation and conversion of native ecosystems. Approximately, 50% of the total areas of cultivated pastures in the Cerrado<sup class="citation-number">72</sup> and more than 60% in the Amazon biomes are considered degraded.<sup class="citation-number">73</sup> In 2010, nearly 40% of the deforested land in the Amazon was either degraded pasture or abandoned areas.<sup class="citation-number">74</sup></p>
                
            <p>Moderate intensification and sustainable ranch management practices can provide potential solutions to help improve pasture and herd productivity. Efforts aimed at addressing the five underlying  issues leading to low productivity (see above) can help mitigate the potential for pasture degradation and therefore reduce pressures to clear additional forests.</p>
