            Clandestine Market

                <p>Estimates of the Number of Cattle Slaughtered by the Clandestine Cattle Industry.<sup class="citation-number">35</sup></p>
            </div>

            <div class="tangent-article-text">
                <p>According to Brazilian law, all meat production facilities are subject to government inspection, to ensure compliance with food safety and hygiene standards. However, these requirements do not extend to non-food items, such as hides and leather. The relative lack of controls on hide/leather production has helped facilitate a clandestine market for these products.</p>
                
                <p>The clandestine market can be estimated by comparing the total number of hides produced with the total number of reported head of cattle slaughtered.<sup class="citation-number">36</sup> As indicated by the figure, the number of hides produced is consistently greater than the total reported number of head of cattle slaughtered, providing evidence of a clandestine market.<sup class="citation-number">37</sup> In 2009, the year demonstrating the lowest percentage in the series, leather tanneries purchased almost 6 million hides that could not be attributed to documented cattle slaughter.<sup class="citation-number">38</sup> </p>
                
                <p>Due to the relative lack of controls on hide/leather production, it is likely that these clandestine hides enter legitimate markets, both domestically in Brazil and as exports to leather producing countries, such as Italy and China. This means that handbags, shoes, upholstery, or other leather goods may have potentially been produced on recently deforested land or using slave labor.</p>
                
                <p>In order to ensure that leather products are not contributing to the loss of forests, human rights violations, or illegalities, procurement should be limited, exclusively, to companies which have implemented systems for monitoring and traceability for verified zero-deforestation production.</p>
