            Clandestine Market

            </div>

            <div class="tangent-article-text">
                <p>According to Brazilian law, all meat production facilities are subject to government inspection, to ensure compliance with food safety and hygiene standards. However, these requirements do not extend to non-food items, such as hides and leather. The relative lack of controls on hide/leather production has helped facilitate a clandestine market for these products.</p>
                
                <p>The clandestine market can be estimated by comparing the total number of hides produced with the total number of reported head of cattle slaughtered. As indicated by the figure, the number of hides produced is greater than the total number of head of cattle slaughtered, providing evidence of a clandestine market.</p>
                
                <p>This figure shows that the percentage difference between the number of hides and the number of slaughters decreased from 44% in 2002 to 21% in 2009. In 2009, the year demonstrating the lowest percentage in the series, leather tanneries purchased almost 6 million hides that could not be attributed to documented cattle slaughter.</p>
                
                <p>Due to the relative lack of controls on hide/leather production, it is likely that these clandestine hides enter legitimate markets, both domestically in Brazil and as exports to leather producing countries, such as Italy and China. This means that some handbags, shoes, upholstery, and other leather goods may have potentially been produced on recently deforested land or using slave labor. In order to ensure that leather products are not contributing to the loss of forests or human rights violations, sourcing should only occur from companies that can ensure verified zero-deforestation production.</p>
