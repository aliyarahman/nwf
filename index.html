                    <div class="chapter-summary-tagline">
                        Fueled by international demand for beef and leather, cattle ranching has rapidly spread north-westwards across Brazil into the Amazon biome – which now supports about one-third of the entire Brazilian cattle herd.<br><br>
                    
                        Cattle ranching is a leading driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The large scale loss of tropical forests jeopardizes critical life support systems that are essential for the sustainability and prosperity of local as well as global communities.

                <div class="chapter-main-text-holder">
                    <div class="chapter-main-text">
                        <p>The Amazon biome covers almost half of the entire Brazilian territory, provides valuable environmental benefits for the planet, and supports millions of individuals and families who rely on this region to sustain their livelihoods.</p>
                        <p>Cattle ranching occurs on over two-thirds of deforested land in the Brazilian Amazon and has been the default land use for rural properties for many decades, in a complex process that includes land occupation, speculation, and cultural tradition. Over the past several decades, this region has undergone a shift from a relatively loose arrangement of un-organized agricultural producers towards more commercially integrated and export-driven production systems.</p>
                        <p>From 1993 to 2013, the cattle herd in the Brazilian Amazon biome expanded by nearly 200%, while the herd in the rest of Brazil increased by only 13%. The large-scale expansion of the cattle herd into the Brazilian Amazon has come at great environmental cost, as large expanses of tropical forests have been cut, burned, and converted to pastures. As a result, over 330,000 km2 of forest (an area larger than Italy) was cleared in the Brazilian Amazon during this period.</p>
                        <p>In many ways, cattle ranching was once “beyond the law” and few efforts were able to effectively change land use practices. However, this trend has changed significantly in recent years. A combination of supply chain interventions, commitments to deforestation-free production, and government policies have helped reduce the rates of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by over 80 percent in the past decade. Continued support from responsible companies throughout the supply chain is helping to sever the links between cattle and forest destruction in the Amazon once and for all.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-summary-tagline">As one of the leading producers and exporters of beef and leather products, the Brazilian cattle sector is highly integrated into global markets. The growth of cattle herd in the Amazon biome played a key role in supporting export-driven expansion of the Brazilian cattle sector, supplying the growing global demand for beef, leather and other cattle-derived products (such as tallow).</div>

                        <p>With the largest commercial cattle herd in the world, Brazil is currently at the forefront of both global production and international trade. In 2014, Brazil ranked as the second largest producer and the largest exporter of beef products in the world.</p> 
                        <p>The top Brazilian beef trade partners in 2014 were China (including Hong Kong), Russia, and the European Union, which collectively accounted for over half of all exports (by value). While China and Russia tend to dominate overall trade, the United States and the United Kingdom are (by far) the largest export destinations for processed beef products, accounting for 35 and 25 percent of total processed beef exports in 2014, respectively.</p> 
                        <p>The primary export destinations for Brazilian hides and leather (by value) are China and Italy. Over the past five years, Brazil has been (on average) the largest source of hides to Italy and the 2nd/3rd largest source for China (after the United States and Australia). Italy and China, the top global leather processors, export the majority of finished leather goods to the United States and the European Union (EU-28). The degree of market integration and value added production in leather supply chains helps illustrate the impacts that consumption preferences in developed nations and sourcing criteria of multi-national brands can have on the Brazilian cattle sector and potentially the Amazon rainforest.</p>
                        <p>Tallow has a wide range of applications, including pet food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, such as soaps. One of the most prominent uses of Brazilian tallow is in the production of biodiesel, which typically consists of a feedstock ratio of about 20 percent tallow. Although the majority of production is consumed domestically, Brazil exported over $32 million US worth of biodiesel to Europe in 2013.  As fuel blend mandates, continue to rely on increasingly greater proportions of biodiesel, tallow is likely to become an increasingly important feedstock for the energy and transportation sectors, both within Brazil and internationally.</p>
                        <p>Support from domestic and international markets for more deforestation-free beef and leather, can have a tremendous impact on the cattle sector in Brazil, especially in ecologically important regions, such as the Amazon biome.</p>

                            <p>During the past decade, significant strides have been made towards reducing cattle-driven deforestation in the Amazon. In 2009, high profile campaigns by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and pressure from the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office (Ministério Público Federal, MPF) in several key states, led to large-scale transformation across much of the Amazon cattle sector. This resulted in two important supply chain interventions: (1) the MPF-TAC Agreement, and (2) the G4 Cattle Agreement.</p>
                            <p>(1) MPF-TAC Agreement: The MPFs sued ranchers who cleared forest illegally and the slaughterhouses that bought from them, and used threats of litigation to convince Brazilian retailers to boycott slaughterhouses connected to illegal deforestation. In response, individual meatpacking companies began signing legally binding agreements (Terms of Adjustment of Conduct) in July 2009 to stop purchasing from properties with illegal deforestation. These agreements have since been expanded and now include two-thirds of the federally inspected slaughterhouses (SIFs) in the Legal Amazon.</p>
                            <p>(2) G4 Cattle Agreement: In October 2009, Brazil’s largest meatpacking companies (JBS, Marfrig, Minerva, and Bertin – which was subsequently purchased by JBS) also signed a zero-deforestation agreement with Greenpeace, known as the G4 Cattle Agreement. Under the agreement, these meatpackers committed to set-up monitoring systems to block the purchase of cattle from ranches with deforestation, slave labor, or located on indigenous lands and conservation areas. The G4 meatpackers collectively slaughter around half of the slaughter in the Legal Amazon, so the G4 Agreement has a wide reach.</p>
                            <p>The G4 and MPF-TAC agreements share many similarities. Meatpacking companies committed to block sales from properties: (1) with deforestation occurring after the agreements or (2) that were not registered in the Rural Environmental Registry (Portuguese acronym CAR), which stores georeferenced property boundaries for monitoring purposes.  </p>
                            <p>The MPF-TAC agreements emphasize avoiding illegal deforestation defined by the Brazilian Forest Code, which stipulates that 80% of a property’s forest area must be reserved as a set-aside across much of the Brazilian Amazon biome. The G4 Agreement goes beyond legality and prohibits any forest clearing, even if it is within the legal limit.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-main-text">
                        <p>Supply chain interventions (such as the MPF-TAC and the G4 Cattle Agreements) offer a promising solution to commodity-driven deforestation. As more multi-national companies commit to stop sourcing from farms and ranches with recent deforestation, these types of initiatives become even more important.  The framework, application, and scope of coverage of these initiatives will be critical in order to ensure effective safeguards for forests and the environment both within Brazil and elsewhere in the tropics.</p> 
                        <br><p>An analysis of the MPF-TAC and G4 Cattle Agreements in Brazil provides evidence that these supply chain interventions had a significant impact on the sourcing of major slaughterhouses in the Amazon. The results from this study indicate that JBS (the largest beef processor in the world) made substantial changes to its procurement criteria after the agreements were formalized, effectively blocking purchases from direct supplying ranches that were found to have deforestation. In addition, supplying ranchers registered their properties in the CAR nearly two years before surrounding non-supplying ranches, indicating that the MPF-TAC and G4 Cattle Agreements were a driving force behind this. Results also indicate that supplying properties had significantly lower rates of deforestation following the agreements.</p>
                        <p>Since 2004, the rate of deforestation in the Amazon has decreased by over 80%. Although many factors contributed to the overall decline in the rate of forest loss, these zero-deforestation agreements have had an impact on cattle-driven deforestation - a leading driver of forest conversion - in the Brazilian Amazon.</p>
                        <p>Despite these important changes in the supply chain, there are still major gaps that need to be addressed. As such, the limited scope of the agreements may diminish the potential outcomes for forest conservation. In order to ensure lasting and wide ranging effects, support is needed to expand the scope of coverage of these supply chain interventions.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-summary-tagline">Preventing deforestation is compatible with the continued growth of the cattle sector in Brazil. Sustainable intensification, through improvements to pasture and herd management, could allow substantial increases in the Amazon cattle herd on existing pasture.

                        <p>An independent property-level analysis of JBS slaughterhouses in southern Pará helps show that G4 meatpackers have indeed taken steps to alter their procurement criteria and monitor their suppliers. The number of properties effectively monitored represents an enormous achievement of the cattle sector.</p>
                        <p>Despite this progress, major challenges still remain to ensuring fully-deforestation free supply chains. The G4 Agreement only extends to three meatpacking companies, which leaves about half of the documented slaughter in the Brazilian Amazon exposed to relatively minimal (if any) monitoring for deforestation and illegal activities. In addition, direct suppliers are the only segment of the supply chain that is current covered by these monitoring efforts. Cattle can move from calving ranches and fattening farms through middlemen and other indirect suppliers without being monitored. Preliminary evidence indicates that the majority of deforestation is now likely occurring on these indirect supplying ranches.</p>

There are several ways that retailers, manufacturers, and other supply chain actors (including individuals and families) can play a crucial role in ensuring lasting, and environmentally and socially responsible, cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon:</div>

                <div class="recommendation">
                    Companies buying beef, leather, tallow (and other cattle-derived products) from Brazil, should preferentially source from meatpackers who have: (1) made commitments to zero-deforestation production and (2) set-up monitoring systems to ensure forest-friendly supply chains.
                </div>
                <div class="recommendation">
                    G4 meatpackers should start to address indirect suppliers, where the majority of deforestation is now likely occurring. Currently, embargoed properties (those with post-2009 deforestation or illegal activities) can circumvent existing monitoring initiatives by selling cattle to a non-embargoed G4 suppliers - a form of laundering. Non-compliant ranches can also take advantage of other loopholes, including sub-dividing the property and selling cattle via “compliant” parcels within the previously embargoed area. Taking action to address indirect suppliers will help close some of the current gaps in monitoring, reduce risks, and help ensure fully deforestation-free supply chains.

                <div class="recommendation">
                    Non-G4 meatpackers operating in the Brazilian Amazon (and elsewhere in the tropics) should commit to zero-deforestation sourcing and set-up monitoring systems to ensure that their suppliers (including both direct and indirect supplying ranches) are not clearing forest.
                </div>
                <div class="recommendation">
                    All meatpackers (i.e. both G4 and non-G4) should make efforts to increase the transparency of their transaction information. Disclosing more information on the ranches which supply cattle to the meatpackers will help identify potential gaps in monitoring, further reduce potential risk exposure, and provide valuable support for efforts aimed at expanding monitoring to indirect suppliers.

                <div class="recommendation">
                    Manufacturers, retailers, and other supply chain actors should participate in the GRSB-GTPS Joint Working Group on Forests (JWG). The JWG is a technical working group of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) and the Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock (GTPS), focused on engagement and collaboration to address forest-related issues in cattle supply chains. The JWG also serves in an advisory role to the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) on efforts to mobilize resources to achieve zero-net deforestation by 2020.

                <div class="recommendation">
                    Government and civil society organizations should support efforts to (1) improve technical assistance, training and education for ranchers, (2) increase adoption of moderate intensification practices that improve pasture and herd output on existing non-forested land (such as, rotational grazing, fences, and grass mixtures), and (3) promote more streamlined processes for the application and allocation of credit and finance for sustainable ranching practices.

                <div class="recommendation">
                    Individuals and families can help by starting the conversation at the local level and asking your favorite retailers and brands simply questions like: “Where do you source your raw materials from?”  - AND – “Do you have a zero-deforestation policy that covers cattle products?”

            <div class="tangent-article-text">Figure 8 shows that the percentage difference between the number of hides and the number of slaughters decreased from 44% in 2002 to 21% in 2009. In 2009, the year demonstrating the lowest percentage in the series, leather tanneries purchased almost 6 million hides that could not be attributed to a cattle slaughter, and on average from 2002-2009, 26% of all slaughters were clandestine. The average monthly difference over the six months of 2010 that were accounted for remained at around half a million hides from unregistered slaughters, with a 21% difference between the number of head of cattle slaughtered and number of hides registered [52].  </div>
