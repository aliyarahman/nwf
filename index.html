                        <p>Cattle ranching occurs on over two-thirds of deforested land in the Brazilian Amazon<sup class="citation-number">1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class="citation-number">2</sup> and has been a default land use for rural properties for many decades, as part of a complex process that includes land occupation, speculation, and cultural tradition. Over the past several decades, this region has undergone a shift from a relatively loose arrangement of un-organized agricultural producers towards more commercially integrated and export-driven production systems.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>From 1993 to 2013, the cattle herd in the Brazilian Amazon biome expanded by nearly 200%, while the herd in the rest of Brazil increased by only 13%.<sup class="citation-number">3</sup> The large-scale expansion of the cattle herd into the Brazilian Amazon has come at great environmental cost, as large expanses of tropical forests have been cut, burned, and converted to pastures. During this period, over 330,000 km2 of forest (an area larger than Italy) was cleared in the Brazilian Amazon.<sup class="citation-number">4</sup></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In many ways, cattle ranching was once “beyond the law” and few efforts were able to effectively change land use practices. However, this trend has changed significantly in recent years. A combination of supply chain interventions, including commitments to zero-deforestation production, and government policies have helped reduce the rates of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by over 80% in the past decade.<sup class="citation-number">5</sup> Continued support from responsible companies throughout the supply chain is providing critical support for solutions that are helping sever the links between cattle and forest destruction in the Amazon once and for all.</p>

One of the most prominent uses of Brazilian tallow is in the production of biodiesel, which typically consists of a feedstock ratio of about 20% tallow. Although the majority of production is consumed domestically, Brazil exported over US $32 million worth of biodiesel to Europe in 2013.v  As fuel blend mandates continue to rely on progressively larger proportions of biodiesel, tallow is likely to become an increasingly important feedstock for the energy and transportation sectors, both within Brazil and internationally.</p>

                            <p class="agreement-bullet"><b>(1) MPF-TAC Agreement</b>: The MPFs sued large ranchers who cleared forest illegally and the slaughterhouses that bought from them, and used threats of litigation to convince Brazilian retailers to boycott slaughterhouses connected to illegal deforestation. In response, individual meatpacking companies began signing legally binding TAC agreements (Terms of Adjustment of Conduct) in July 2009, committing to avoid purchases from properties with illegal deforestation. These agreements now include two-thirds of the federally inspected slaughterhouses (SIFs) in the Legal Amazon.<sup class="citation-number">15</sup></p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="agreement-bullet"><b>(2) G4 Cattle Agreement</b> In October 2009, Brazil’s largest meatpacking companies (JBS, Marfrig, Minerva, and Bertin – which was subsequently purchased by JBS) also signed a zero-deforestation agreement with Greenpeace, known as the G4 Cattle Agreement. Under the agreement, these meatpackers committed to set up monitoring systems to block the purchase of cattle from ranches with deforestation and illegal activities. The G4 meatpackers collectively account for around half of the documented slaughter in the Legal Amazon, so this commitment has a wide reach.<sup class="citation-number">16</sup></p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The two agreements share many similarities. Meatpacking companies committed to block sales from properties with deforestation occurring after the agreements or that were not registered in the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), which stores georeferenced property boundaries for monitoring purposes.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The MPF-TAC agreements emphasize avoiding illegal deforestation defined by the Brazilian Forest Code, which stipulates that 80% of a property’s forest area must be reserved as a set-aside across much of the Brazilian Amazon biome. The G4 Agreement goes beyond legality and prohibits any forest clearing, even if it is within the legal limit.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-summary-tagline">Supply chain interventions, such as the Cattle Agreements, offer a promising solution to commodity-driven deforestation. As multi-national companies continue to make commitments to stop sourcing from farms and ranches with recent deforestation, these types of initiatives are growing increasingly more powerful as pragmatic solutions to commodity-driven deforestation.  The scope, tenants, and implementation of these initiatives are critical to ensure effective safeguards for forests and the environment both within Brazil and elsewhere in the tropics. </div>

                        <p>Our analysis of the Cattle Agreements demonstrates that they significantly and rapidly changed meatpacker and rancher behavior in the state of Pará. Rancher surveys, property-level analysis, and rigorous statistical analysis were combined to demonstrate the following: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>JBS slaughterhouses significantly changed purchase behavior and sourcing criteria, and now actively block sales from direct suppliers with deforestation.<sup class="citation-number">18</sup></li>
                                <li>Supplying ranchers were rapidly incentivized to register their properties in the publicly available Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), more than two years ahead of surrounding properties.<sup class="citation-number">19</sup></li>
                                <li>Supplying ranchers responded to the market signals and dramatically reduced deforestation on their properties.<sup class="citation-number">20</sup></li>

                        <p>Despite this progress, major challenges still remain to ensuring fully verified zero-deforestation cattle production. The G4 Agreement only extends to three meatpacking companies, which leaves about half of the documented slaughter in the Brazilian Amazon exposed to relatively minimal (if any) monitoring for deforestation and illegal activities. In addition, direct suppliers are the only segment of the supply chain that is current covered by these monitoring efforts. Cattle can move from calving ranches and fattening farms through middlemen and other indirect suppliers without being monitored. Preliminary evidence indicates that the majority of deforestation is now likely occurring on these indirect supplying ranches.</p>
                        <br> 
                        <p>In addition, there are currently no unified and robust audits to check the criteria of the commitments. To ensure compliance with the agreements, a unified, independent auditing system is needed. The results of these audits should be publically available so that all stakeholders in the supply chain can make informed decisions about the performance of this sector.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are several ways that retailers, manufacturers, and other supply chain actors (including individuals and families) can help ensure environmentally sound, socially responsible, and economically viable cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To build collaborative solutions and scale up verified zero-deforestation cattle production, supply chain actors should participate in the GRSB-GTPS Joint Working Group on Forests (JWG). The JWG is a technical working group of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) and the Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock (GTPS), focused on engagement and collaboration to address forest-related issues in cattle supply chains.</p>

                Preventing deforestation is compatible with the growth of the cattle sector in Brazil. Sustainable intensification, through improvements to pasture and herd management, could allow substantial increases in the Amazon cattle herd on existing pasture. This can be achieved while improving the profitability of the ranching sector and safeguarding the ecological value of the Amazon.

                <p>Healthy, intact forests provide valuable ecosystem benefits for local, regional, and global communities. They provide habitat for wildlife, support biodiversity, and remove large amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the atmosphere. Forests also help regulate important bio-geophysical processes, such as precipitation patterns and nutrient cycles, which are critical for the productivity of agriculture.</p>

                <p>The Amazon rainforest acts as a giant “water pump” for much of South America, releasing billions of liters of water from the trees into the atmosphere in the form of water vapor. This process of transpiration, in which massive amounts of water vapor rise from the forests and travel eastwards across the continent, has been referred to as “flying rivers”. These “flying rivers” supply substantial amounts of water to the densely populated metropolitan centers on the eastern seaboard. </p>

                <p>The large scale loss of tropical forests in the Amazon can trigger complex interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere.<sup class="citation-number">22</sup> Unrelenting deforestation and expansion of agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon may be a “no-win” scenario as climate feedbacks are likely to (1) reduce the quantity and frequency of overall average precipitation,<sup class="citation-number">23</sup> (2) increase mean temperatures and heat extremes,<sup class="citation-number">24</sup> and (3) increase the length of the dry season and the severity of droughts.<sup class="citation-number">25</sup> The degradation of these critical ecosystem services could significantly jeopardize the potential productivity of agricultural for the region. Large scale productivity losses could cause supply shocks in the market and increase the price volatility of cattle products.</p>

                <p>Under a “business as usual” scenario, pasture productivity in the Brazilian Amazon has been forecasted to potentially decrease by 33% by 2050, due to climate feedbacks associated with continued forest destruction.<sup class="citation-number">26</sup></p>
                
                <p>In addition to these localized effects, deforestation in the Amazon can act as a driver of regional climate change and may impact rainfall patterns in areas as far as the western United States.<sup class="citation-number">27</sup> Large scale forest loss in the Amazon has been estimated to potentially reduce precipitation by up to 20% in the coastal northwest United States and by up to 50% in the Sierra Nevada snowpack, jeopardizing critical agricultural production areas.<sup class="citation-number">28</sup></p> 

                <p>Commitments to verified zero-deforestation cattle production throughout the supply chain are helping to ensure that forests are conserved, safeguarding the valuable ecosystem benefits that they provide.</p>

                <p>According to Brazilian law, all meat production facilities are subject to government inspection, to ensure compliance with food safety and hygiene standards. However, these requirements do not extend to non-food items, such as hides and leather. The relative lack of controls on hide/leather production has helped facilitate a clandestine market for these products.</p>
                
                <p>The clandestine market can be estimated by comparing the total number of hides produced with the total number of reported head of cattle slaughtered. As indicated by the figure, the number of hides produced is greater than the total number of head of cattle slaughtered, providing evidence of a clandestine market.</p>
                
                <p>This figure shows that the percentage difference between the number of hides and the number of slaughters decreased from 44% in 2002 to 21% in 2009. In 2009, the year demonstrating the lowest percentage in the series, leather tanneries purchased almost 6 million hides that could not be attributed to documented cattle slaughter.</p>
                
                <p>Due to the relative lack of controls on hide/leather production, it is likely that these clandestine hides enter legitimate markets, both domestically in Brazil and as exports to leather producing countries, such as Italy and China. This means that some handbags, shoes, upholstery, and other leather goods may have potentially been produced on recently deforested land or using slave labor. In order to ensure that leather products are not contributing to the loss of forests or human rights violations, sourcing should only occur from companies that can ensure verified zero-deforestation production.</p>

                <p>Brazil’s beef export market has rapidly expanded in recent decades, outpacing the growth of domestic consumption in Brazil. Between 1994 and 2009, domestic consumption of beef increased by nearly 50%.<sup class="citation-number">34</sup> During this same time period, exports increased by over 500%.<sup class="citation-number">35</sup> </p>
                <p>The growth in the relative share of exports helps highlight the increasing importance of global supply chain actors and the level of global market integration of Brazilian beef products, especially in countries such as Russia and China, which account for the majority of trade.</p>
                <p>Through responsible procurement and commitments to verified zero-deforestation production, supply chain actors, both within Brazil and internationally, can support forest-friendly ranching practices and help conserve ecologically sensitive areas, such as the Amazon.</p>

                <p>This figure illustrates annual deforestation rates and the growth of the cattle herd in the Brazilian Amazon biome. From 1990 to 2004, there is evidence of a positive correlation between forest loss and cattle production, with both increasing during this period. However, post-2004, the rate of deforestation declines considerably, while the average rate of cattle production continues to increase.</p> 
                <p>This helps demonstrate that cattle production does not need to come at the expense of forests. The cattle sector in the Brazilian Amazon can grow sustainably by increasing the productive capacity of existing pastures.</p>

Since then, it has undergone several revisions, most recent of which occurred in 2012, when controversial amendments were introduced that many conservationists felt weakened the law.

                <p>Using various models and climatic datasets, we produced the first estimate of the carrying capacity of Brazil’s 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands. We then investigated if the improved use of cultivated pasturelands would free enough land for the expansion of meat, crops, wood and biofuel, respecting biophysical constraints (i.e., terrain, climate) and including climate change impacts. We found that the current productivity of Brazilian cultivated pasturelands is 32–34% of its potential and that increasing productivity to 49–52% of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat, crops, wood products and biofuels until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems. As a result up to 14.3 Gt CO2 Eq could be mitigated.</p>

            <p><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 1: ZERO-DEFORESTATION COMMITMENTS ARE WORKING</span> 
            <ul>
                <li>The cattle sector has made significant  progress to address deforestation on direct suppliers (Tier 1 Ranches) and these efforts deserve support and recognition.</li>
                <li>Substantial gaps remain in the monitoring and traceability of indirect suppliers (Tier 2 Ranches). Support for efforts that address indirect suppliers is the next step on the path to fully deforestation-free production; this will further reduce risks, help expand market access, and bolster the global reputation of Brazilian beef. </li> 
                <li>Many stakeholders are not yet participating in deforestation-free supply chains. Efforts to expand monitoring and traceability to meatpackers not currently participating in the G4 Cattle Agreement would help increase the coverage of these supply chain initiatives and would level the playing field in this industry.</li> 
                <li>Market incentives linking retailers, meatpackers, and producers coupled with strong government backing can support continued monitoring and traceability from G4 meatpackers as well as encourage wider adoption of these practices to non-G4 meatpackers. </li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><br><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 2: MODERATE INTENSIFICATION HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL</span>
            <ul>
                <li>There remains enormous opportunities to recover degraded pastures, improve productivity (stocking densities and yields), and increase the profitability of Brazilian cattle ranching through the adoption of moderate intensification practices.</li> 
                <li>The G4 Cattle Agreement represents one of the strongest mechanisms currently in place to reduce deforestation in cattle supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon. For moderate intensification to effectively reduce deforestation while avoiding rebound effects and other negative externalities, it should be strategically integrated with the G4 Cattle agreement (or G4-like agreements).</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><br><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 3: FINANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IS AVAILABLE</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Finance for moderate intensification is available; however, issues related to accessibility have created bottlenecks that are limiting the flow of credit.</li>
                <li>A unified and reliable source of information on land tenure, legality, and risk exposure holds great potential to increase the flow of finance to cattle operations.</li> 
                <li>The current cap on technical assistance may be hindering adoption of moderate intensification practices, especially with smaller ranches (< 1,100 hectares).</li>
