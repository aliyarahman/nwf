                    <div class="chapter-summary-tagline">
                        Fueled by international demand for beef and leather, cattle ranching has rapidly spread north-westwards across Brazil into the Amazon biome – which now supports about one-third of the entire Brazilian cattle herd.<br><br>
                    
                        Cattle ranching is a leading driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The large scale loss of tropical forests jeopardizes critical life support systems that are essential for the sustainability and prosperity of local as well as global communities.

                <div class="chapter-main-text-holder">
                    <div class="chapter-main-text">
                        <p>The Amazon biome covers almost half of the entire Brazilian territory, provides valuable environmental benefits for the planet, and supports millions of individuals and families who rely on this region to sustain their livelihoods.</p>
                        <p>Cattle ranching occurs on over two-thirds of deforested land in the Brazilian Amazon and has been the default land use for rural properties for many decades, in a complex process that includes land occupation, speculation, and cultural tradition. Over the past several decades, this region has undergone a shift from a relatively loose arrangement of un-organized agricultural producers towards more commercially integrated and export-driven production systems.</p>
                        <p>From 1993 to 2013, the cattle herd in the Brazilian Amazon biome expanded by nearly 200%, while the herd in the rest of Brazil increased by only 13%. The large-scale expansion of the cattle herd into the Brazilian Amazon has come at great environmental cost, as large expanses of tropical forests have been cut, burned, and converted to pastures. As a result, over 330,000 km2 of forest (an area larger than Italy) was cleared in the Brazilian Amazon during this period.</p>
                        <p>In many ways, cattle ranching was once “beyond the law” and few efforts were able to effectively change land use practices. However, this trend has changed significantly in recent years. A combination of supply chain interventions, commitments to deforestation-free production, and government policies have helped reduce the rates of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by over 80 percent in the past decade. Continued support from responsible companies throughout the supply chain is helping to sever the links between cattle and forest destruction in the Amazon once and for all.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-summary-tagline">As one of the leading producers and exporters of beef and leather products, the Brazilian cattle sector is highly integrated into global markets. The growth of cattle herd in the Amazon biome played a key role in supporting export-driven expansion of the Brazilian cattle sector, supplying the growing global demand for beef, leather and other cattle-derived products (such as tallow).</div>

                        <p>With the largest commercial cattle herd in the world, Brazil is currently at the forefront of both global production and international trade. In 2014, Brazil ranked as the second largest producer and the largest exporter of beef products in the world.</p> 
                        <p>The top Brazilian beef trade partners in 2014 were China (including Hong Kong), Russia, and the European Union, which collectively accounted for over half of all exports (by value). While China and Russia tend to dominate overall trade, the United States and the United Kingdom are (by far) the largest export destinations for processed beef products, accounting for 35 and 25 percent of total processed beef exports in 2014, respectively.</p> 
                        <p>The primary export destinations for Brazilian hides and leather (by value) are China and Italy. Over the past five years, Brazil has been (on average) the largest source of hides to Italy and the 2nd/3rd largest source for China (after the United States and Australia). Italy and China, the top global leather processors, export the majority of finished leather goods to the United States and the European Union (EU-28). The degree of market integration and value added production in leather supply chains helps illustrate the impacts that consumption preferences in developed nations and sourcing criteria of multi-national brands can have on the Brazilian cattle sector and potentially the Amazon rainforest.</p>
                        <p>Tallow has a wide range of applications, including pet food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, such as soaps. One of the most prominent uses of Brazilian tallow is in the production of biodiesel, which typically consists of a feedstock ratio of about 20 percent tallow. Although the majority of production is consumed domestically, Brazil exported over $32 million US worth of biodiesel to Europe in 2013.  As fuel blend mandates, continue to rely on increasingly greater proportions of biodiesel, tallow is likely to become an increasingly important feedstock for the energy and transportation sectors, both within Brazil and internationally.</p>
                        <p>Support from domestic and international markets for more deforestation-free beef and leather, can have a tremendous impact on the cattle sector in Brazil, especially in ecologically important regions, such as the Amazon biome.</p>

                            <p>During the past decade, significant strides have been made towards reducing cattle-driven deforestation in the Amazon. In 2009, high profile campaigns by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and pressure from the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office (Ministério Público Federal, MPF) in several key states, led to large-scale transformation across much of the Amazon cattle sector. This resulted in two important supply chain interventions: (1) the MPF-TAC Agreement, and (2) the G4 Cattle Agreement.</p>
                            <p>(1) MPF-TAC Agreement: The MPFs sued ranchers who cleared forest illegally and the slaughterhouses that bought from them, and used threats of litigation to convince Brazilian retailers to boycott slaughterhouses connected to illegal deforestation. In response, individual meatpacking companies began signing legally binding agreements (Terms of Adjustment of Conduct) in July 2009 to stop purchasing from properties with illegal deforestation. These agreements have since been expanded and now include two-thirds of the federally inspected slaughterhouses (SIFs) in the Legal Amazon.</p>
                            <p>(2) G4 Cattle Agreement: In October 2009, Brazil’s largest meatpacking companies (JBS, Marfrig, Minerva, and Bertin – which was subsequently purchased by JBS) also signed a zero-deforestation agreement with Greenpeace, known as the G4 Cattle Agreement. Under the agreement, these meatpackers committed to set-up monitoring systems to block the purchase of cattle from ranches with deforestation, slave labor, or located on indigenous lands and conservation areas. The G4 meatpackers collectively slaughter around half of the slaughter in the Legal Amazon, so the G4 Agreement has a wide reach.</p>
                            <p>The G4 and MPF-TAC agreements share many similarities. Meatpacking companies committed to block sales from properties: (1) with deforestation occurring after the agreements or (2) that were not registered in the Rural Environmental Registry (Portuguese acronym CAR), which stores georeferenced property boundaries for monitoring purposes.  </p>
                            <p>The MPF-TAC agreements emphasize avoiding illegal deforestation defined by the Brazilian Forest Code, which stipulates that 80% of a property’s forest area must be reserved as a set-aside across much of the Brazilian Amazon biome. The G4 Agreement goes beyond legality and prohibits any forest clearing, even if it is within the legal limit.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-main-text">
                        <p>Supply chain interventions (such as the MPF-TAC and the G4 Cattle Agreements) offer a promising solution to commodity-driven deforestation. As more multi-national companies commit to stop sourcing from farms and ranches with recent deforestation, these types of initiatives become even more important.  The framework, application, and scope of coverage of these initiatives will be critical in order to ensure effective safeguards for forests and the environment both within Brazil and elsewhere in the tropics.</p> 
                        <br><p>An analysis of the MPF-TAC and G4 Cattle Agreements in Brazil provides evidence that these supply chain interventions had a significant impact on the sourcing of major slaughterhouses in the Amazon. The results from this study indicate that JBS (the largest beef processor in the world) made substantial changes to its procurement criteria after the agreements were formalized, effectively blocking purchases from direct supplying ranches that were found to have deforestation. In addition, supplying ranchers registered their properties in the CAR nearly two years before surrounding non-supplying ranches, indicating that the MPF-TAC and G4 Cattle Agreements were a driving force behind this. Results also indicate that supplying properties had significantly lower rates of deforestation following the agreements.</p>
                        <p>Since 2004, the rate of deforestation in the Amazon has decreased by over 80%. Although many factors contributed to the overall decline in the rate of forest loss, these zero-deforestation agreements have had an impact on cattle-driven deforestation - a leading driver of forest conversion - in the Brazilian Amazon.</p>
                        <p>Despite these important changes in the supply chain, there are still major gaps that need to be addressed. As such, the limited scope of the agreements may diminish the potential outcomes for forest conservation. In order to ensure lasting and wide ranging effects, support is needed to expand the scope of coverage of these supply chain interventions.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-summary-tagline">Preventing deforestation is compatible with the continued growth of the cattle sector in Brazil. Sustainable intensification, through improvements to pasture and herd management, could allow substantial increases in the Amazon cattle herd on existing pasture. This can be achieved while improving the profitability of the ranching sector and safeguarding the ecological value of the Amazon.</div>

                        <p>An independent property-level analysis of JBS slaughterhouses in southern Pará helps show that G4 meatpackers have indeed taken steps to alter their procurement criteria and monitor their suppliers. The number of properties effectively monitored represents an enormous achievement of the cattle sector.</p>
                        <p>Despite this progress, major challenges still remain to ensuring fully-deforestation free supply chains. The G4 Agreement only extends to three meatpacking companies, which leaves about half of the documented slaughter in the Brazilian Amazon exposed to relatively minimal (if any) monitoring for deforestation and illegal activities. In addition, direct suppliers are the only segment of the supply chain that is current covered by these monitoring efforts. Cattle can move from calving ranches and fattening farms through middlemen and other indirect suppliers without being monitored. Preliminary evidence indicates that the majority of deforestation is now likely occurring on these indirect supplying ranches.</p>

            <div class="recommendations-actor">RANCHERS</div>
            <p>Ranchers should make efforts to ensure that their properties are legally compliant, including CAR registration and Legal Reserve (LR) minimums. In situations of LR deficit, ranchers should make efforts to support the restoration or compensation of the LR deficit through programs such as the CRA. When feasible, ranchers should adopt moderate intensification practices that improve pasture and herd output on existing non-forested land (such as, rotational grazing, fences, and grass mixtures).</p>

        <div class="recommendations-subcolumn">
            <div class="recommendations-actor">MEATPACKERS</div>
            <p>G4 (and non-G4) meatpackers should start to address indirect suppliers, where the majority of deforestation is now likely occurring. Taking action to address indirect suppliers will help close some of the current gaps in monitoring, reduce risks, and help ensure fully deforestation-free supply chains.</p> 

            <p>Non-G4 meatpackers operating in the Brazilian Amazon (and elsewhere in the tropics) should commit to zero-deforestation and use monitoring systems to ensure that their suppliers (including both direct and indirect supplying ranches) are not clearing forest.</p>

            <p>All meatpackers (G4 and non-G4) should make efforts to increase the transparency of their transaction information. Disclosing more information on the ranches which supply cattle to the meatpackers will help identify potential gaps in monitoring, further reduce potential risk exposure, and provide valuable support for efforts aimed at expanding monitoring to indirect suppliers.</p>

                <p>Companies buying beef, leather, tallow, and other cattle-derived products from Brazil, should preferentially source from meatpackers who: (1) have made commitments to zero-deforestation production and (2) use monitoring systems to ensure forest-friendly supply chains.</p>

                <p>Manufacturers, retailers, and other supply chain actors should participate in the GRSB-GTPS Joint Working Group on Forests (JWG). The JWG is a technical working group of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) and the Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock (GTPS), focused on engagement and collaboration to address forest-related issues in cattle supply chains. The JWG also serves in an advisory role to the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) on efforts to mobilize resources to achieve zero-net deforestation by 2020.</p>

                <p>The Brazilian government should increase transparency of data regarding the transportation of cattle (Guia de Transporte Animal, GTA). Disclosing more information on the movement of cattle will help support efforts aimed at expanding monitoring and traceability to indirect suppliers in the supply chain.</p>
                <p>The government should also support efforts to (1) improve technical assistance, training and education for ranchers, (2) increase adoption of moderate intensification practices that improve pasture and herd output on existing non-forested land (such as, rotational grazing, fences, and grass mixtures), and (3) promote more streamlined processes for the application and allocation of credit and finance for sustainable ranching practices.<p>

                Individuals and families can help by starting the conversation at the local level and asking your favorite retailers and brands simply questions like: “Where do you source your raw materials from?”  - AND – “Do you have a zero-deforestation policy that covers cattle products?”

                <p><b>The Science</b>: Growing tropical forests are already removing a large portion of current emissions from the atmosphere, serving as a natural carbon capture and storage technology.[12 Forests affect the climate at continental scales by bringing rainfall to inland farmers.[13] Advances in remote sensing technology make it possible to track and respond to deforestation events in near real time and to measure forest-based emissions annually with a high degree of accuracy.[14]</p>

                <p><b>The Economics</b>: Fresh analysis confirms that including forest conservation in climate mitigation strategies is a “best bet” for achieving more, cheaper, and faster global emission reductions.[15]The national and local economic benefits provided by tropical forests are substantially undervalued in development decision-making.[16] Following decades of research on what causes deforestation, and what policies can stop it,[17]Brazil has proven that it is possible to reduce deforestation while increasing agricultural production.[18]</p>

                <p><b>The Politics</b>: Through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the global community has agreed on a framework to reward forest countries for reducing deforestation,[19]and leaders in those countries are ready to act. Actions to address the drivers of tropical deforestation can be aligned with domestic constituencies for reform in forest countries, including those interested in clarifying the rights of indigenous peoples, those working to increase transparency and reduce corruption in decision-making related to natural resources, and those whose livelihoods depend on the goods and services provided by forests.[20] In rich countries, providing performance-based finance directly to national and local governments in forest countries and removing perverse subsidies for commodities that drive deforestation appeal to a wide range of constituencies.[21]</p>

                <p>The unprecedented drought now affecting São Paulo, South America’s giant metropolis, is believed to be caused by the absence of the “flying rivers” − the vapour clouds from the Amazon that normally bring rain to the centre and south of Brazil.</p>
                <p>Some Brazilian scientists say the absence of rain that has dried up rivers and reservoirs in central and southeast Brazil is not just a quirk of nature, but a change brought about by a combination of the continuing deforestation of the Amazon and global warming.</p>
                <p>This combination, they say, is reducing the role of the Amazon rainforest as a giant “water pump”, releasing billions of litres of humidity from the trees into the air in the form of vapour.</p>
                <p>Meteorologist Jose Marengo, a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, first coined the phrase “flying rivers” to describe these massive volumes of vapour that rise from the rainforest, travel west, and then − blocked by the Andes − turn south.</p>
                <p>Satellite images from the Centre for Weather Forecasts and Climate Research of Brazil’s National Space Research Institute (INPE) clearly show that, during January and February this year, the flying rivers failed to arrive, unlike the previous five years.</p>

                <p>According to Brazilian law, all meat production facilities are subject to government inspection, to ensure compliance with food safety and hygiene standards. However, these requirements do not extend to non-food items, such as hides and leather. The relative lack of controls on hide/leather production has helped facilitate a clandestine market for these products.</p>
                <p>This figure provides evidence that a clandestine market for cattle products exists in Brazil, especially for hides/leather. The clandestine market can be estimated by comparing the total number of hides produced with the total number of reported head of cattle slaughtered. As indicated by the figure, the number of hides produced is greater than the total number of head of cattle slaughtered, providing evidence of a clandestine market.</p>

                <p>Brazil’s beef export market has rapidly expanded in recent decades, making Brazil the world’s biggest beef exporter [40]. While domestic consumption of beef increased almost 50% between 1994-2009, exports tripled, and between 2005 and 2009, 24% of beef was exported (Figure 6) averaging around USD 4 billion in value [47]. The major export destinations for all beef products (fresh, frozen and processed) were Russia, China, Iran and the United States, with over half of exports going to the Middle East and Asia (Fig. 6). However, considering processed beef, 69% of exports by value went to the U.S., U.K., Italy and the Netherlands, the top destination being the U.S., which in 2009 received 34% of Brazil’s processed meat exports [60]. Of all types of beef, in 2009, 20% of exports by value were destined for the E.U. and the U.S., with a combined value of USD 840 million, which represents 4% of total Brazilian beef production by weight [60].

                <p>Using various models and climatic datasets, we produced the first estimate of the carrying capacity of Brazil’s 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands. We then investigated if the improved use of cultivated pasturelands would free enough land for the expansion of meat, crops, wood and biofuel, respecting biophysical constraints (i.e., terrain, climate) and including climate change impacts. We found that the current productivity of Brazilian cultivated pasturelands is 32–34% of its potential and that increasing productivity to 49–52% of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat, crops, wood products and biofuels until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems.

            <p><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 1: ZERO-DEFORESTATION COMMITMENTS ARE WORKING</span> 
            <ul>
                <li>The cattle sector has made significant  progress to address deforestation on direct suppliers (Tier 1 Ranches) and these efforts deserve support and recognition.</li>
                <li>Substantial gaps remain in the monitoring and traceability of indirect suppliers (Tier 2 Ranches). Support for efforts that address indirect suppliers is the next step on the path to fully deforestation-free production; this will further reduce risks, help expand market access, and bolster the global reputation of Brazilian beef. </li> 
                <li>Many stakeholders are not yet participating in deforestation-free supply chains. Efforts to expand monitoring and traceability to meatpackers not currently participating in the G4 Cattle Agreement would help increase the coverage of these supply chain initiatives and would level the playing field in this industry.</li> 
                <li>Market incentives linking retailers, meatpackers, and producers coupled with strong government backing can support continued monitoring and traceability from G4 meatpackers as well as encourage wider adoption of these practices to non-G4 meatpackers. </li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><br><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 2: MODERATE INTENSIFICATION HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL</span>
            <ul>
                <li>There remains enormous opportunities to recover degraded pastures, improve productivity (stocking densities and yields), and increase the profitability of Brazilian cattle ranching through the adoption of moderate intensification practices.</li> 
                <li>The G4 Cattle Agreement represents one of the strongest mechanisms currently in place to reduce deforestation in cattle supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon. For moderate intensification to effectively reduce deforestation while avoiding rebound effects and other negative externalities, it should be strategically integrated with the G4 Cattle agreement (or G4-like agreements).</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><br><span class="tangent-article-sub-subtitle">SESSION 3: FINANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IS AVAILABLE</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Finance for moderate intensification is available; however, issues related to accessibility have created bottlenecks that are limiting the flow of credit.</li>
                <li>A unified and reliable source of information on land tenure, legality, and risk exposure holds great potential to increase the flow of finance to cattle operations.</li> 
                <li>The current cap on technical assistance may be hindering adoption of moderate intensification practices, especially with smaller ranches (< 1,100 hectares).</li>
